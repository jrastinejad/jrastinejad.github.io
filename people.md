I am currently a PhD candidate in the Fong research group at Northwestern University. In 2019, I graduated from the University of Connecticut, where I double-majored in Physics and Human Rights, and minored in Mathematics and Astrophysics.

I grew up in two beautiful New England towns: Old Saybrook, Connecticut, and Sudbury, Massachusetts. Though the Midwest's flatness took some getting used to, I enjoy living in Chicago and experiencing the vibrant comedy, unique neighborhoods and beautiful lakefront that the city has to offer. I am half-Chinese and half-Iranian, and like to try new recipes/scattered directions from my grandmother from these cultures in my free time.
