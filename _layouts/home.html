    <h3 class="fw-bold">Welcome!</h3>
    <p>I am a <a href="https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/funding/fellowships-and-grants/internal-fellowships-grants/presidential-fellowship-winners/fellowship-winners.html">Presidential Fellow</a> and Astronomy Ph.D. Candidate in the 
      Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (<a href="https://ciera.northwestern.edu">CIERA</a>) and Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northwestern University. 
      I am also an active member of the Searches After Gravitational Waves Using ARizona Observatories (<a href="https://saguaro-mma.github.io">SAGUARO</a>) Collaboration.</p>
    <h3 class="fw-bold">Research</h3>
    <p>I leverage rapid-response observations from premiere telescopes (like Gemini-North Observatory, pictured here!) to study the astrophysical origins of the heavy elements, including silver and gold. My research aims to answer questions such as: 
      <i>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the explosions that create heavy elements?</li>
          <li>How does an explosion's mass and composition connect to Gamma-ray and Gravitational Wave properties?</li>
          <li>What can these explosions teach us about black holes and neutron stars?</li>
        </ul>
