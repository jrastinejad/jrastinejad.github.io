    <h3 class="fw-bold">Welcome!</h3>
    <p>I am a NASA Einstein Fellow researching the catacalysmic explosions of stars. I am based at the University of Maryland, College Park.
      I am an active member of the Searches After Gravitational Waves Using ARizona Observatories (<a href="https://saguaro-mma.github.io">SAGUARO</a>) Collaboration.
      I earned my PhD in Astronomy from Northwestern University in September 2025, 
      where I was a <a href="https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/funding/fellowships-and-grants/internal-fellowships-grants/presidential-fellowship-winners/fellowship-winners.html">Northwestern Presidential Fellow</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 class="fw-bold">Research</h3>
    <p>I leverage rapid-response observations from premier telescopes (like Gemini-North Observatory, pictured here!) to study the astrophysical origins of the heavy elements, including silver and gold. My research aims to answer questions such as: 
      <i>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the explosions that create heavy r-process elements?</li>
          <li>What can the explosions of massive stars and compact object mergers teach us about black holes and neutron stars?</li>
          <li>How do these explosions' properties, like mass and composition, connect to their high-energy or gravitational wave features?</li>
          <li>What physics drives the emerging population of Fast X-ray Transients?</li>
        </ul>
